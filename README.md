# Ecomm-Funnel-Analysis
End-to-end analysis of a simulated e-commerce dataset with session-based funnel tracking, conversion insights by device/location/channel, and marketing ROI evaluation. Built to reflect real-world data analyst work.



##  Project Objective

To analyze user behavior across key e-commerce funnel stages — from visit to purchase — and evaluate the effectiveness of different marketing channels through metrics like Conversion Rate, Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), and Return on Investment (ROI). The goal is to deliver actionable business insights for product and marketing teams.



##  Key KPIs Tracked

-  Funnel conversion rate (visit → view → cart → checkout → purchase)
-  Device-wise and location-wise conversion analysis
-  Channel-wise performance (Email, Instagram, Google Ads)
-  ROI and CAC per marketing channel
-  Session metrics (event sequences, durations)



##  Visualizations

The project includes 5 high-value charts:

-  Funnel drop-off chart
-  Conversion rate by marketing channel
-  CAC comparison per channel
-  Device-type distribution pie chart
-  ROI bar plot per channel

All charts are saved in a `visuals/` folder for reference.



##  Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- Markdown



##  Key Insights

- Email campaigns had the **highest ROI (32,000%)** and lowest CAC — best performing channel.
- Most drop-offs occurred **between cart and checkout** — suggests friction in the buying process.
- **Mobile users** converted slightly lower than desktop users — UX optimization recommended.
- **Bangalore and Delhi** emerged as high-converting locations worth targeting.
- Instagram delivered the most traffic but was **less cost-effective** compared to Email.



##  Business Recommendations

- Increase investment in Email campaigns.
- Optimize mobile checkout experience to reduce drop-offs.
- Improve cart-to-checkout flow — possibly reduce steps or simplify payment options.
- Target high-performing locations with tailored promotions.
- Re-evaluate Instagram ad strategy to improve ROI.



##  Deliverables

-  Cleaned and processed dataset
-  KPI calculations and visualizations
-  One-page stakeholder-ready business report
-  GitHub documentation (this README)
